**A Stateful, Desktop-Class TUI Framework for Go**

`vtui` is a modern, cross-platform Terminal User Interface (TUI) framework for Go. It is heavily inspired by classic desktop UI paradigms—specifically **Turbo Vision** (Borland) and the **Far Manager** internal UI kit.

Unlike modern web-inspired TUI libraries that use Flexbox or Grid layouts, `vtui` is designed from the ground up for building complex, **stateful** applications: file managers, database clients, IDEs, and heavy-duty text editors.

## Why vtui? (Comparison with tcell/tview)

While `tcell` is an excellent low-level terminal driver and `tview` is a great high-level component library, `vtui` is built with a fundamentally different philosophy:

| Feature | tcell + tview / cview | vtui (this project) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Abstractions** | **Driver + Widgets.** Low-level canvas with Flexbox-like layout containers. | **Application Framework.** Full-featured OOP hierarchy (Dialogs, Menus, Focus cycles). |
| **Layout Mode** | **Flexbox/Grid.** Modern web-like proportions. | **GrowMode (Turbo Vision style).** "Rubber" layout with anchors, perfect for pixel-perfect TUI dialogs. |
| **Input** | Standard Terminfo-based mapping. | **[vtinput](https://github.com/unxed/vtinput) integration.** Native support for Kitty/Win32 protocols (distinguishes `Ctrl+Enter`, `Shift+Tab`, etc.). |
| **Rendering** | Full-widget declarative redraw. | **ScreenBuf + ShadowBuf.** Bitwise diffing. Only changed cells are sent via minimal ANSI sequences. |
| **Memory/GC** | Standard Go allocations during redraws. | **Zero-allocation rendering.** Designed to stay GC-silent during the `Flush()` cycle to eliminate micro-stutters. |
| **Input Lag** | Standard parsing (can be sensitive to fast bursts). | **Event Draining.** Optimized for "instant" feel and bracketed paste without flickering. |

### When to use `vtui`:
- You are building a **heavy-duty tool** where the user spends hours (File Manager, Spreadsheet, Hex Editor).
- You need **perfect keyboard support** (all modifiers, key-up/key-down events).
- You want the **classic UX** of Far Manager or Turbo Vision (Movable Windows, Modal Dialogs, Dropdown Menus).
- You need an application architecture that manages Z-ordering and focus cycles automatically.

## Core Architecture

### 1. The Screen Buffer (`ScreenBuf`)
At the lowest level, `vtui` uses a strict double-buffering approach. 
*   The application logic draws to a logical grid of `CharInfo` cells (which hold 24-bit TrueColor attributes and Unicode characters).
*   When `Flush()` is called, `vtui` compares the logical buffer with a "shadow" buffer representing the physical terminal state. 
*   It generates and writes the absolute minimum ANSI escape sequences needed to transition the terminal to the new state. This step is allocation-free.

### 2. The Frame Manager (`FrameManager`)
The heart of `vtui`. It manages a stack (Z-order) of `Frame` objects.
*   **Desktop:** The bottom layer.
*   **Panels/Windows:** User-defined workspaces.
*   **Dialogs:** Modal popups that trap focus.
*   **Menus:** Context menus or dropdowns that automatically close when losing focus.
The `FrameManager` routes `vtinput.InputEvent`s to the top-most active frame, handles background repainting via `SaveScreen` (saving the content under a dialog to restore them instantly when it closes), and manages global components like the `MenuBar` and `StatusLine`.

### 3. GrowMode Layout
Instead of containers and flex-ratios, widgets within a Dialog are positioned using absolute coordinates and `GrowMode` flags.
If a dialog is resized, a widget can:
*   `GrowNone`: Stay exactly where it is.
*   `GrowHiX`: Stretch its right edge (e.g., an `Edit` field expanding to fill width).
*   `GrowLoX | GrowHiX | GrowLoY | GrowHiY`: Keep its relative distance from the bottom-right corner (e.g., an "OK" button anchored to the bottom).
### 4. Pluggable Renderers (`SurfaceRenderer`)
The framework abstracts the physical output through the `SurfaceRenderer` interface. This allows the same UI code to run in different environments:

*   **AnsiRenderer:** The default backend. Translates buffer changes into optimized ANSI escape sequences for standard terminals.
*   **Win32GuiRenderer:** A lightweight, pure-Go native Win32/GDI backend using standard Windows API (CreateWindowEx, BitBlt, SetDIBitsToDevice). Works across all Windows versions and runs out of the box under Wine without GPU or CGO dependencies.
*   **GogpuRenderer:** A hardware-accelerated backend that draws directly to a GPU-backed window using the `gogpu` library. Provides crisp text rendering and high FPS.
*   **EbitenRenderer:** A cgo-free backend built on [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org). The grid is rasterised on the CPU and uploaded as a single GPU texture per frame; an unchanged screen costs neither an upload nor a blit. Supports HiDPI and shares the geometric frame rasteriser with the X11 and Wayland backends. Its reason to exist is dependency independence: it needs neither cgo nor the gogpu stack, so `CGO_ENABLED=0` cross-compilation keeps working on Linux, Windows and macOS.
*   **CocoaGuiRenderer:** A native macOS backend: an AppKit window driven through the Objective-C runtime with purego, no cgo. The grid is rasterised on the CPU by the same code as the Win32 backend and handed to Core Animation as a CoreGraphics image, so it needs no GPU stack either. `go run ./cmd/cocoa-smoke` checks it end to end; see [PLATFORMS.md](PLATFORMS.md).
*   **X11/Wayland Renderers:** Native Unix backends that draw to software bitmapped windows without requiring a terminal emulator.
*   **PureX11Renderer:** A 100% pure Go X11 backend using the XGB library and SHM. Experimental and requires further testing.

You can select a backend at startup by passing the desired driver to `vtui.RunInGUIWindow`.

## Built-in Widgets

`vtui` comes with a standard library of controls that look and feel exactly like Far Manager:

*   `Dialog`, `BorderedFrame` (Single/Double line Win32-style boxes)
*   `Button`, `Checkbox`, `RadioButton`
*   `Edit` (Single-line input with scrolling, history, password masking, and text selection)
*   `ListBox`, `ComboBox`
*   `Table` (Multi-column list with alignment and scrollbars)
*   `VMenu` (Context menus), `MenuBar` (Top-level dropdown menus)
*   `KeyBar` (F1-F12 function key hints at the bottom), `StatusLine`
*   Common Dialogs: `ShowMessage`, `InputBox`, `SelectFileDialog`, `SelectDirDialog`

## Visual Integrity & Testing

`vtui` uses an automated **Layout Validator** to ensure that all dialogs follow strict design guidelines: no overlapping elements, proper spacing ("air"), and correct padding from window borders. Every new dialog or window component must include a unit test that calls `vtui.AssertLayout`. See [UI_TESTING.md](UI_TESTING.md) for detailed instructions and test boilerplate.

## Quick Start Example

```go
package main

import (
	"os"
	"github.com/unxed/vtinput"
	"github.com/unxed/vtui"
	"golang.org/x/term"
)

func main() {
	// 1. Enable advanced terminal input
	restore, _ := vtinput.Enable()
	defer restore()

	// 2. Initialize the Screen Buffer
	width, height, _ := term.GetSize(int(os.Stdin.Fd()))
	scr := vtui.NewScreenBuf()
	scr.AllocBuf(width, height)

	// 3. Boot the Frame Manager
	vtui.FrameManager.Init(scr)
	vtui.FrameManager.Push(vtui.NewDesktop())

	// 4. Create a Dialog
	dlg := vtui.NewDialog(0, 0, 40, 10, " Hello vtui ")
	dlg.Center(width, height)
	dlg.ShowClose = true

	// Add an Edit field
	edit := vtui.NewEdit(dlg.X1+2, dlg.Y1+3, 36, "Type here...")
	dlg.AddItem(vtui.NewLabel(dlg.X1+2, dlg.Y1+2, "&Name:", edit))
	dlg.AddItem(edit)

	// Add an OK button
	btn := vtui.NewButton(dlg.X1+16, dlg.Y1+7, "&Ok")
	btn.OnClick = func() {
		vtui.ShowMessage(" Result ", "You typed:\n"+edit.GetText(), []string{"&Close"})
	}
	dlg.AddItem(btn)

	vtui.FrameManager.Push(dlg)

	// 5. Start the event loop
	vtui.FrameManager.Run()
}
```

## Demo app

The repository includes a demo app that showcases widgets and layout features. You can run it directly in the terminal or test different GUI backends using command-line flags:

```bash
go run ./cmd/test-app                 # Default terminal mode
go run ./cmd/test-app --gui=gogpu     # Hardware-accelerated GPU window
go run ./cmd/test-app --gui=x11       # Native X11 window
go run ./cmd/test-app --gui=wayland   # Native Wayland window
go run ./cmd/test-app --gui=ebiten    # Ebitengine window, no cgo required
go run ./cmd/test-app --gui=cocoa     # Native macOS window, no cgo, no GPU
```

### Building the ebiten backend without cgo

```
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./...
```

Cgo-free builds of this backend need Ebitengine `main` (v2.10.0-alpha or later).
The last tagged release, v2.9.9, still requires cgo on Linux and macOS: the
purego ports of GLFW and of the Metal driver landed after it. On 32-bit ARM and
on the BSDs the backend is compiled out and `--gui=ebiten` reports that the
platform is unsupported.
